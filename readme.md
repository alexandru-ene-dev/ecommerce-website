## Final Words

This project started as a challenge - learning fullstack development by building something real, end to end. It's not a clone of Amazon or Shopify, and it's not packed with every feature an e-commerce site could have.

But it works, it's deployed, and it taught me more than any tutorial ever could.

Feel free to explore, give feedback, or fork it and build on it.
